# 🏦 Credit Card Approval Prediction - Introduction

## 📌 Project Overview

In this project, we aim to develop a machine learning model that predicts whether a customer is likely to be **approved for a credit card**, based on their personal and financial history. The goal is to support credit institutions in automating the decision-making process, identifying creditworthy clients while reducing financial risk.

To achieve this, we will perform a full **end-to-end machine learning pipeline**, including:

- Data cleaning and integration
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature engineering
- Binary classification modeling
- Model evaluation and interpretation

## 📁 Datasets Description

We are using **two datasets** that must be joined together to form a complete view of each applicant:

1. **`application_record.csv`**  
   Contains demographic and personal financial information for each customer.
   - Each row represents a unique client identified by `ID`.
   - Features include gender, income, education level, family size, housing type, etc.

2. **`credit_record.csv`**  
   Contains historical credit behavior data per client.
   - Multiple rows per client (also identified by `ID`).
   - Includes monthly status codes for each client (e.g., payment behavior).

By merging and transforming these two datasets, we can extract a **target variable** (such as default risk or late payment behavior) and train models to classify whether a client should be approved.

## 🎯 Objective

Build and evaluate machine learning models that can **predict credit card approval** (or a proxy target like “likely to default”) based on:

- Demographic attributes
- Past credit behavior
- Financial status

This is a **binary classification problem** — the model will output either "approve" or "not approve".

## 🧠 Why this matters

Accurate credit approval systems reduce:
- **Default risk** for financial institutions
- **Manual workload** for credit officers
- **Bias** in human decision-making (if fairness is also analyzed)

At the same time, they help ensure that responsible applicants are not denied credit unfairly.
